### Hello everyone!

I am Michael Primo, I am 28 years old and I like programming and mathematics, other than games and puzzles.

Actually I am studying Javascript for making a better frontend for websites, games and animations.

Here I will post what I do. Follow me and get in touch to see what I am doing!
